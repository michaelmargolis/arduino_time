Arduino Time library

The Time library adds timekeeping functionality to Arduino with or without external timekeeping hardware.
It allows a sketch to get the time and date as: second, minute, hour, day, month and year.
It also provides time as a standard C time_t so elapsed times can be easily calculated and time values shared across different platforms.

TimeAlarms is a companion library that enables you to run functions at specific times.

D1307RTC is a companion library that adds support for a real time clock to maintain time of day when Arduino is not powered.
